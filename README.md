This is the project respository for course: intro to deeplearning 

We tried vanilla transformer and pretrained Roberta Model for next word prediction task on DailyDialog Dataset

The performance of Roberta was much better than the vanilla transformer. We tried to use knowledge distillation(vanilla transformer as student, Roberta as teacher)
